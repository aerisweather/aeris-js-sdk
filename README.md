Using the SDK requires that you have an active Aeris Weather API subscription.

## Using Our Hosted Version

Our Aeris Javascript SDK is intended to be loaded using our hosted version on our servers as they will always provide the most recent production release of the SDK. All of our documentation and tutorials utilize this method. However, you can also use the source code provided here to use your own version of the SDK. To do so, just review how the samples are setup, which use the local files in the project instead of our hosted versions.
